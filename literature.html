<h5>
When searching the literature, possible search terms included “spatial
frame(s) of reference.” This term was paired with the names of specific
countries to generate cross-cultural studies (e.g., “germany”). We used
search engines like PsycInfo and Google Scholar. Additionally, when we
identified a certain researcher who had contributed many relevant works,
we searched directly on their Google Scholar profile and their website
in an attempt to find more papers. We only included papers if they
studied the use of spatial frames of reference in at least one
non-English-speaking sample.
