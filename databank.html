<h5>
<p>From each paper, each task performed by a different cultural group is
entered in ATLAS as its own row. A task consists of a different
procedure or outcome variable. A group differs if they speak a different
language, live in a different place, etc.</p>
<p>For instance, some papers consist of multiple studies. In that case,
each study, at minimum, will be coded on as many rows as the number of
different cultural groups who participated. (e.g., If two groups
completed one study that consisted of a single task, then the study will
be coded on two rows, one for each group.)</p>
In some cases, a study will consist of multiple subtasks. In that case,
each subtask gets its own row; these should be distinguished using the
TaskID variable. (e.g., If two groups completed one study that consisted
of three subtasks, then the study will be coded on six rows — 2 groups x
3 tasks.)
